- Main aim of creating stop list is to avoid words that occur huge number of times (tf) in the corpus and hence losing its   importance.
- But the tf should not only be the deciding factor. Stop words should include words such that even after removing those
  from a sentence, it does not alter the overall meaning of that sentence.
- I have chosen above stop words based on its high occurence and its importance in the sentences in which it appears.
- For instance, 'edit' appears around 8378 time. Eventhough it occurs more frequently, it should not be a part of stop
  list since it could alter the overall meaning of the sentenc if removed from the corpus
- 'or' appears 7728 times,'be' appears 7464,'it' appears 7398. Eventhough these words occur less frequently than 'edit',
  its made as part of the stop list since it does not alter the overall meaning of the sentence when removed.
- If cut-off value chosen is higher than 'edit' tf, then 'or','it' will not be a part of stop list. So, a value lower than
  7398 can be chosen. To avoid, 'edit' being part of stop list, the word can be compared with a manually preapared stop   list so that 'edit' will not be a part of stop list.
- So, by examining all the above scenarios, I would chose cut-off value as 7000.
